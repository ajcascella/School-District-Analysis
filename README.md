In this project I analyzed district-wide standardized test results including every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. I aggregated the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

The final report includes the following:

### District Summary

* District's key metrics, including:
  * Total Schools
  * Total Students
  * Total Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math
  * % Passing Reading
  * Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)

### School Summary

* Table that summarizes key metrics about each school, including:
  * School Name
  * School Type
  * Total Students
  * Total School Budget
  * Per Student Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math
  * % Passing Reading
  * Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)

### Top Performing Schools (By Passing Rate)

* Table that highlights the top 5 performing schools based on Overall Passing Rate. Includes:
  * School Name
  * School Type
  * Total Students
  * Total School Budget
  * Per Student Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math
  * % Passing Reading
  * Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)

### Bottom Performing Schools (By Passing Rate)

* Table that highlights the bottom 5 performing schools based on Overall Passing Rate. Includes all of the same metrics as above.

### Math Scores by Grade\*\*

* Table that lists the average Math Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

### Reading Scores by Grade

* Table that lists the average Reading Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

### Scores by School Spending

* Table that breaks down school performances based on average Spending Ranges (Per Student). Include in the table each of the following:
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math
  * % Passing Reading
  * Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)

### Scores by School Size

* Repeats the above breakdown, but this time the schools are grouped based based on a reasonable approximation of school size (Small, Medium, Large).

### Scores by School Type

* Repeats the above breakdown, but this time group schools based on school type (Charter vs. District).
